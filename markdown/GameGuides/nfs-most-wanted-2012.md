## Photo Mode controls

To enable the photo mode, you need to be connected to AutoLog and pause the game. The PM will start by default.

Command | Keyboard - Controller
--|--
Move Camera | `Arrows` - <font face="Controller"><</font>
Up/Down | `A`/`Z` - <font face="Controller">{ / }</font>
Rotate Camera | `Home`, `End`, `Del`, `Pg Down` - <font face="Controller">></font>
Zoom In/Out | `Num 2`/`Num 8` - <font face="Controller">W / X</font>
Tilt Left/Right | `Insert`/`Pg Up` - <font face="Controller">[ / ]</font>
HUD toggle | `F6`
Screen dirt effect toggle | `F7`
TOD switch | `F8`

The TOD switch lets you cycle through midnight, dawn, sunrise, midday, sunset, and dusk.

@alert Tip
If pausing doesn't bring up the PM you gotta connect to AutoLog again. While unpaused, open the EasyDrive menu, go to the first option called "Autolog recommends" and then select the "Connect to AutoLog" option.
@end

## Tips and Tricks
- The photomode also provides some effects, like being able to edit the brightness, contrast, and motion blur.
- Even if the PM has a toggler for car damage it only changes the broken textures, the car's model will still look crashed. Also, this won't remove any dirt on the car.
- The HD Effects mod comes with a .ini to edit a lot of options. Feel free to edit these options to your liking, but beware as high numbers can make the game crash while playing above 4k resolutions.
- You can rebind the HD Effects hotkeys by editing the same .ini file mentioned above.
