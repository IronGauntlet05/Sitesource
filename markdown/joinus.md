Our Discord server is the beating heart of FRAMED. It's where we gather to discuss screenshots, contribute to the site, and talk about whatever else we want.

---

We pride ourselves on being active members of a closely-knit server, whether that be giving feedback to others, working on new guides for the site, or just showing up to chat and make friends. **Participation is a must**, as FRAMED is a community first and foremost. It is not a place to share your shots and run, nor is it a place for you to lurk. We want you to keep this community the friendly and welcoming place it's grown into over the years. *Inactive members may be removed at our discretion.*

You may find the [Hall of FRAMED](https://framedsc.com/HallOfFramed/) to be quite intimidating. It is one of the best showcases of virtual photography out there, after all. But FRAMED is a place for everyone, from legendary screenshotters whose names you may have seen in the news, to beginners that have just opened a camera tool for the very first time. We only ask that you have a keen interest in learning and sharing everything about screenshotting.
